# 🚧 Pothole-Detection-and-Anaysis-With-Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision

## Overview

This project is an advanced computer vision system that detects, tracks, and analyzes potholes in real-time from video footage. Using YOLOv8 segmentation and custom tracking algorithms, it provides:

* Real-time pothole visualization
* Size and risk classification
* Comprehensive analytics dashboard
* Automated report generation

## Key Features

* 🎯 **Accurate Detection**: YOLOv8 segmentation for precise pothole identification
* 📏 **Size Classification**: Small, Medium, Large based on area thresholds
* ⚠️ **Risk Assessment**: Low, Medium, High based on size and position
* 🔄 **Object Tracking**: Consistent ID assignment across frames
* 📊 **Dashboard**: Real-time statistics display
* 📝 **Automated Reporting**: Detailed analysis with severity ratings

## Visual Indicators

| Element                  | Description                               | Visual            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Low-risk potholes**    | Small potholes away from road center      | 🟢 Green overlay  |
| **Medium-risk potholes** | Medium potholes or small ones near center | 🟠 Orange overlay |
| **High-risk potholes**   | Large potholes or critical position       | 🔴 Red overlay    |

## Outputs

### Real-time Visualization

* Color-coded pothole overlays (green/orange/red)
* Tracking IDs and risk levels displayed
* Safe path indicators (yellow lines)
* Statistics dashboard (top-left corner):

  * Current frame pothole counts
  * Total unique potholes detected
  * Size distribution (Small/Medium/Large)

### Generated Analysis Report

The system generates `pothole_analysis_report_<timestamp>.txt` containing:

1. **Video metadata** (filename, duration, frames analyzed)
2. **Pothole statistics:**

   * Size distribution
   * Risk classification
   * Average pothole area
3. **Road condition severity rating** (0-10 scale)
4. **Maintenance recommendations**

## Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the script:

* `small_threshold = 5000`: Area threshold for small potholes
* `large_threshold = 15000`: Area threshold for large potholes
* `proximity_threshold = 400`: Distance for marking potholes
* `coordinate_threshold = 50`: Distance for tracking same pothole
